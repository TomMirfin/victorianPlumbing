\***_ Tom Mirfin Grid Task _**

Tech stack used:

- React
- Tailwind
- Zustand
- Tanstack Query
- Axios

** Tailwind **
I used tailwind for ease of use on a growing project. In a live project situatuion I would set up custom components for ease of use

** Zustand **
As the project grows using a state management system would ensure the codebase was kept clean and would stop prop drilling

** Tanstack Query **
Not used to its full effect here but as the project developed the caching and optimistic rendering options in tanstack would support the growth
