# Tom Mirfin Grid Task

### Tech stack used:
- **React**
- **Tailwind**
- **Zustand**
- **Tanstack Query**
- **Axios**

### Tailwind  
I used Tailwind for ease of use on a growing project. In a live project situation, I would set up custom components for consistency and maintainability.

### Zustand  
As the project grows, using a state management system like Zustand would ensure a clean codebase and prevent excessive prop drilling.

### Tanstack Query  
Though not fully utilized here, Tanstack Queryâ€™s caching and optimistic rendering features would be beneficial as the project scales.
